Descriptive Information
Business Group is used to capture the designs and plans of statistical programmes, and the processes undertaken to deliver those programmes.

The information classes defined within this group as as follows:

Assessment
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Assessment	Business	result of the analysis of the quality and effectiveness of any activity undertaken by a statistical organisation and recommendations on how these can be improved	An Assessment can be of a variety of types. One example may include a gap analysis, where a current state is determined along with what is needed to reach its target state. Alternatively, an Assessment may compare current processes against a set of requirements, for example a new Statistical Need or change in the operating environment. An Assessment can use various classes as inputs, whether they are the main classes that the Assessment is about or auxiliary classes that help accomplish the Assessment.

Business Case
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Business Case	Business	proposal for a body of work that will deliver outputs designed to achieve outcomes	A Business Case is produced as a result of a detailed consideration of a Change Definition. It sets out a plan for how the change described by the Change Definition can be achieved. A Business Case usually comprises various evaluations. The Business Case will specify the stakeholders that are impacted by the Statistical Need or by the different solutions that are required to implement it. A Business Case will provide the reasoning for undertaking a Statistical Support Activity to initiate a new Statistical Programme Design for an existing Statistical Programme, or an entirely new Statistical Programme, as well as the details of the change proposed.

Business Function
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Business Function	Business	activities undertaken by a statistical organisation to achieve its objectives	A Business Function delivers added value from a business point of view. It is delivered by bringing together people, processes and technology (resources), for a specific business purpose. Business Functions answer in a generic sense What business purpose does this Business Service _or Process Step_ serve? (c.f. Business Process answers the question of How?). Through identifying the Business Function associated with each Business Service or Process Step, it increases the documentation of the use of the associated Business Services and Process Steps, to enable future reuse. A Business Function may be defined directly with descriptive text and/or through reference to an existing catalogue of Business Functions. The phases and sub-processes defined within GSBPM can be used as an internationally agreed basis for cataloguing high-level Business Functions. A catalogue might also include Business Functions defined at a lower level than sub-process. For example, Identify and address outliers might be catalogued as a lower level Business Function with the Review and validate function (5.3) defined within GSBPM.

Business Process
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Business Process	Business	structured and repeatable activity that performs one or more Business Functions	For example, a particular Statistical Programme Cycle might include several data acquisition activities, the corresponding editing activities for each acquisition and the production and dissemination of final outputs. Each of these may be considered separate Business Processes for the Statistical Programme Cycle.	 

Attributes
* Attributes inherited from super-type(s) are not included here

Business Service
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Business Service	Business	means of performing a Business Function	A Business Service may provide one means of accessing a particular Business Function. The operation of a Business Service will perform one or more Business Processes. The explicitly defined interface of a Business Service can be seen as representing a service contract. If particular inputs are provided then the service will deliver particular outputs in compliance within specific parameters (for example, within a particular period of time). Note: The interface of a Business Service is not necessarily IT based. For example, a typical postal service will have a number of service interfaces:
- Public letter box for posting letters
- Counter at post office for interacting with postal workers	 

Attributes
Name	Description	Cardinality	Value Type
Service Interface	Specifies how to communicate with the service.	0..*	String

Change Definition
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Change Definition	Business	structured, well-defined specification for a proposed change	A related class - the Statistical Need - is a change expression as it has been received by an organisation. A Statistical Need is a raw expression of a proposed change, and is not necessarily well-defined. A Change Definition is created when a Statistical Need is analysed by an organisation, and expresses the raw need in well-defined, structured terms. A Change Definition does not assess the feasibility of the change or propose solutions to deliver the change - this role is satisfied by the Business Case class. The precise structure or organisation of a Change Definition can be further specified by rules or standards local to a given organisation. It also includes the specific Concepts to be measured and the Population that is under consideration. Once a Statistical Need has been received, the first step is to do the conceptual work to establish what it is we are trying to measure. The final output of this conceptual work is the Change Definition. The next step is to assess how we are going to make the measurements - to design a solution and put forward a proposal for a body of work that will deliver on the requirements of the original Statistical Need.

Core Input
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Core Input	Business	essential input for the Process Step Instance	Core Input is a sub-type of Process Input. Producers of official statistics often conceptualise data (and sometimes metadata) flowing through the statistical Business Process, having statistical value added by each Process Step. The concept of Core Input allows this notional flow of information through the production process to be traced, without confusing these inputs with other inputs - such as Parameter Inputs and Process Support Inputs that are controlling or influencing a particular Process Step but do not flow through the Business Process in the same sense. Typical Core Inputs are Data Sets and structural metadata.	 

Attributes
* Attributes inherited from super-type(s) are not included here

Core Output
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Core Output	Business	key output of the Process Step Instance	A Core Output is a sub-type of Process Output. Typically a Core Output is either a Process Input to a subsequent Process Step or it represents the final product from a statistical Business Process. In many cases a Core Output may be readily identified as an updated (value added) version of one or more Core Inputs supplied to the Process Step Instance.

Environment Change
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Environment Change	Business	requirement for change that originates from a change in the operating environment of the statistical organisation	An Environment Change reflects change in the context in which a statistical organisation operates. Environment Changes can be of different origins and also take different forms. They can result from a precise event (budget cut, new legislation enforced) or from a progressive process (technical or methodological progress, application or tool obsolescence). Other examples of Environment Changes include the availability of a new Information Resource, the opportunity for new collaboration between organisations, etc.	 

Attributes

Information Request
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Information Request	Business	Statistical Need that is a request for new information for a particular purpose	An Information Request is a special case of Statistical Need that may come in an organised form, for example by specifying on which Subject Field the information is required. It may also be a more general request and require refinement by the statistical agency and formalised in a Change Definition.	 

Attributes

Parameter Input
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Parameter Input	Business	Process Input that specifies the run-time configuration used in a parameterised Process Step Instance	Parameter Inputs may be provided where Rules and/or Business Service interfaces associated with a particular Process Step have been designed to be configurable based on Process Input Specification. Parameter Inputs are passed into the Process Step Instance.

* Attributes inherited from super-type(s) are not included here

Process Control
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Control	Business	set of decision points which determine the flow between the Process Steps used to perform a Business Process	The typical use of Process Control is to determine what happens after a Process Step is executed. The possible paths, and the decision criteria, associated with a Process Control are specified as part of designing a production process, captured in a Process Control Design. There is typically a very close relationship between the design of a process and the design of a Process Control.	 

Attributes
* Attributes inherited from super-type(s) are not included here

Process Control Design
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Control Design	Business	specification of the decision points required during the execution of a Business Process	The design of a Process Control typically takes place as part of the design of the process itself. This involves determining the conditional routing between the various sub-processes and services used by the executing process associated with the Process Control and specified by the Process Control Design. _It is possible to define a _Process Control where the next step in the_ Process Step_ that will be executed is a fixed value rather than a choice between two or more possibilities. Where such a design would be appropriate, this feature allows, for example, initiation of a step in the Process Step representing the GSBPM Process Phase (5) to always lead to initiation of GSBPM sub-process Integrate Data (5.1) as the next step. This allows a process designer to divide a Business Process into logical steps (for example, where each step performs a specific Business Function through re-use of a Business Service) even if these Process Steps will always follow each other in the same order. In all cases, the Process Control Design defines and the Process Control manages the flow between Process Steps, even where the flow is trivial. Process Design is left to focus entirely on the design of the process itself, not sequencing between steps.

Process Design
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Design	Business	specification of each Process Step and description of their arrangement in a Business Process needed to perform a Business Function	A Process Design is the design time specification of a Process Step that is performed as part of a run-time Business Service. A Process Step can be as big or small as the designer of a particular Business Service chooses. From a design perspective, one Process Step can contain sub-steps, each of which is conceptualised as a (smaller) Process Step in its own right. Each of those sub-steps may contain sub-steps within them and so on. It is a decision for the process designer to what extent to subdivide steps. At some level it will be appropriate to consider a Process Step to be a discrete task without warranting further subdivision. At that level the Process Step is designed to process particular Process Inputs, according to a particular Process Method, to produce particular Process Outputs. The flow between a Process Step and any sub steps is managed via Process Control.

Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Input	Business	instance of an information class supplied to a Process Step Instance	Process Input might include information that is used to produce outputs (e.g. a Data Set), to control specific parameters of the process , and as reference to guide the process (e.g. a Code List).	 

Attributes
* Attributes inherited from super-type(s) are not included here

Process Input Specification
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Input Specification	Business	set of information classes that function as inputs to a Process Design	The Process Input Specification enumerates the Process Inputs required at the time a Process Design is executed. For example, if five different Process Inputs are required, the Process Input Specification will describe each of the five inputs. For each required Process Input the Process Input Specification will record the type of information class (based on GSIM) which will be used as the Process Input (example types might be a Data Set or a Statistical Classification). The Process Input to be provided at the time of Process Step execution will then be a specific instance of the type of information class specified by the Process Input Specification. For example, if a Process Input Specification requires a Data Set then the corresponding Process Input provided at the time of Process Step execution will be a particular Data Set.

Process Method
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Method	Business	specification of the methodology which will be used to perform the work	The methodology specified by a Process Method is independent from any choice of technologies and/or other tools which will be used to apply that technique in a particular instance. The definition of the methodology may, however, intrinsically require the application of specific Rules (for example, mathematical or logical formulas). A Process Method describes a particular method for performing a Process Step.	 

Attributes

Process Metric
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Metric	Business	Process Output summarising some aspect or property of the execution	A Process Metric is a sub-type of Process Output which records information about the execution of a Process Step. For example, how long it took to complete execution of the Process Step and what percentage of records in the Core Input was updated by the Process Step to produce the Core Output. One purpose for a Process Metric may be to provide a quality measure related to the Core Output. For example, a Process Step with the Business Function of imputing missing values is likely to result, as its Core Output, in a Data Set where values that were missing previously have been imputed. Statistical quality measures, captured as Process Metrics for that Process Step may include a measure of how many records were imputed, and a measure of how much difference, statistically, the imputed values make to the dataset overall which can be also used as a part of a quality report associated with the Data Set produced. Another purpose for a Process Metric may be to measure an aspect of the Process Step which is not directly related to the Core Output it produced. For example, a Process Metric may record the time taken to complete the Process Step or other forms of resource utilisation (for example, human and/or IT). Often these two kinds of Process Metrics will be used in combination when seeking to, for example, monitor and tune a statistical Business Process so its statistical outputs achieve the highest level of quality possible based on the time, staff and/or IT resources that are available.

Process Output Specification
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Output Specification	Business	set of information classes that function as outputs of a Process Design	The Process Output Specification enumerates the Process Outputs that are expected to be produced at the time a Process Design is executed. For example, if five different Process Outputs are expected, the Process Output Specification will describe each of the five outputs. For each expected Process Output the Process Output Specification will record the type of information class (based on GSIM) which will be used as the Process Output (Example types might be a Data Set or a Statistical Classification). The Process Output to be provided at the time of Process Step execution will then be a specific instance of the type of information class specified by the Process Output Specification. For example, if a Process Output Specification expects a Data Set then the corresponding Process Output provided at the time of Process Step execution will be a particular Data Set.

Process Pattern
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Pattern	Business	recommended set of Process Designs that is highlighted for possible reuse	In a particular Business Process, some Process Steps may be unique to that Business Process while others may be applicable to other Business Processes. A Process Pattern can be seen as a reusable template. It is a means to accelerate design processes and to achieve sharing and reuse of design patterns which have proved effective. Reuse of Process Patterns can indicate the possibility to reuse related Business Services. By deciding to reuse a Process Pattern, a designer is actually reusing the pattern of Process Designs and Process Control Designs associated with that Process Pattern. They will receive a new instance of the Process Designs and Process Control Designs. If they then tailor their instance of the Process Designs and Process Control Designs to better meet their needs they will not change the definition of the reusable Process Pattern.

Process Step
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Step	Business	unit of work	A Process Step implements the Process Design specified in order to produce the outputs for which the Process Step was designed. Each Process Step is the use of a Process Design in a particular context (e.g., within a specific Business Process). At the time of execution a Process Step Instance specifies the actual instances of input classes (for example, specific Data Sets, specific Conceptual Variables) to be supplied.

Process Step Instance
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Process Step Instance	Business	executed step in a Business Process specifying the actual inputs to and outputs from an occurrence of a Process Step	Each Process Step is the use of a Process Design in a particular context (e.g. within a specific Business Process). At the time of execution a Process Step Instance specifies the actual instances of input classes (for example, specific Data Sets, specific Conceptual Variables) to be supplied. Each Process Step Instance may produce unique results even though the Process Step remains constant. Even when the inputs remain the same, metrics such as the elapsed time to complete execution of the process step may vary from execution to execution. For this reason, each Process Step Instance details of inputs and outputs for that instance of the implementation of the Process Step. In this way it is possible to trace the flow of execution of a Business Process through all the Process Steps which were involved.

Rule
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Rule	Business	mathematical or logical expression which can be evaluated to determine specific behavior	Rules are of several types: they may be derived from methods to determine the control flow of a process when it is being designed and executed (e.g. imputation rules, edit rules); and they may be used to drive the logical flow of a questionnaire. There are many forms of Rules and their purpose, character and expression can vary greatly.

Statistical Need
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Statistical Need	Business	requirement, request or other notification that will be considered by a statistical organisation.	The Statistical Need is a proposed or imposed requirement, request or other notification as it has been received by a statistical organisation. A Statistical Need is an expression of a requirement, and is not necessarily well-defined. A related class - Change Definition - is created when a Statistical Need is analysed by the organisation. Change Definition expresses the raw need in well-defined, structured terms.
Once a Statistical Need has been received, the first step is to do the conceptual work to establish what it is we are trying to measure. The final output of this conceptual work is the Change Definition.
In some cases, the Statistical Need can result from the Assessment of the quality, efficiency, etc. of an existing process. A Statistical Need may be of a variety of types including Information Request.

Statistical Programme
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Statistical Programme	Business	set of activities to produce statistics on a given Universe within the context of Subject Fields	The Statistical Programme provides the environmental context in which activities to produce statistics within a statistical organisation are conducted. Statistical Programme will usually correspond to an ongoing activity such as a survey or output series covered by GSBPM phase 4-7. Some examples of Statistical Programme are:
- Labour Force Survey
- Multipurpose Household Survey
- National Accounts
- Demography
- Overseas Arrivals and Departures
Related to the Statistical Programme class, there are Statistical Programme Design and Statistical Programme Cycle classes that hold the detailed information about the design and conduct of the Business Process. A Statistical Programme could take as inputs other Statistical Programmes outputs, e.g. national accounts. These activities are all carried out to generate Products. In the case of the traditional approach, an organisation has received a Statistical Need and produced a Change Definition and an approved Business Case. The Business Case will specify either a change to the design or methodology of an existing Statistical Programme, which will result in a new Statistical Programme Design; or a change to one or more existing Statistical Programmes (for example, to add an additional objective to the Statistical Programme); or result in a new Statistical Programme being created. This does not include statistical support functions such as metadata management, data management (and other overarching GSBPM processes) and design functions. These activities are conducted as part of Statistical Support Activity.

Presentation can be in different forms; e.g. tables, graphs, structured data files. Examples:
- A table of data. Based on a Data Set, the related Data Structure is used to label the column and row headings for the table. The Data Set is used to populate the cells in the table. Reference metadata is used to populate footnotes and cell notes on the table. Confidentiality rules are applied to the Data Set to suppress any disclosive cells.
- A data file based on a standard (e.g. SDMX).
- A PDF document describing a Statistical Classification.
- Any structural metadata object expressed in a standard format (e.g. DDI 3.1 XML).

Product
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Product	Exchange	package of content that can be disseminated as a whole	A Product packages Information Sets for an Information Consumer. The Product is generated according to Output Specifications, which define how the information from the Information Sets are presented (via Presentations) to the Information Consumer. A Provision Agreement between the statistical organisation and the Information Consumer governs the use of a Product by the Information Consumer. The Provision Agreement, which may be explicitly or implicitly agreed, provides the legal or other bases by which the two parties agree to exchange data. In many cases, dissemination Provision Agreements are implicit in the terms of use published by the statistical organisation. For static Products (e.g. paper publications), specifications are predetermined. For dynamic Products, aspects of specification could be determined by the Information Consumer at run time. Both cases result in Output Specifications specifying Information Set data or referential metadata that will be included within the Product.

Question
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Question	Exchange	text used to elicit a response for a Conceptual Variable	A Question may be a single question used to obtain a response, or may be a multiple question, a construct which links multiple sub-questions, each with their own response. A Question also includes a relationship to the Value Domain to document the associated response criteria for the question. A single response question will have one Value Domain associated with it, while a multiple question may have more than one Value Domain. A Question should be designed with re-use in mind, as it can be used in multiple Questionnaires. In a national implementation, Question could be further subtyped into:
- QuestionGrid, useful to model questions as grids/tables. It is actually a cube-like structure providing dimension information, labelling options, and response domains attached to one or more cells within the grid. For instance, a two-way table requesting to provide turnovers broken down by affiliates.
- QuestionItem, a simple question that is necessarily one dimensional. For example: How old are you?	Multiple Question

Questionnaire Specification	Exchange	Exchange Specification for Questionnaire	This represents the complete questionnaire design, with a relationship to the top-level Questionnaire Component. There may be many different Questionnaire Specifications, for the same surveys, or tailored to individual observation Units (respondents) so that there would be a different Questionnaire Specification for each respondent. The design would also differ depending upon the specific mode of collection the Questionnaire is designed for.

Register
Definition
Class	Group	Definition	Explanatory Text	Synonyms
Register	Exchange	written and complete record containing regular entries of items and details on particular sets of objects	In official statistics, statistical registers and adminisitrative registers (registers maintained by other organisations, usually administrative data owners) are usually distinguished. In GSIM, the information class Register is used to describe both types because the attributes are more or less the same so from the information management point of view, they can be handled as one GSIM class. There is usually a purpose or authority for maintaining the Register and each object in the Register is described using a pre-defined set of characteristics. Examples include business and population registers as used by statistical organisations. Therefore, from statistical perspective, the Register can be interpreted as a set of objects for a given Population, updated on a regular basis, containing information on identification, accessibility of Units and other attributes. The Register contains the current and historical statuses of the Population and the causes, effects and sources of alterations in the Population. In order to better understand how the Register is used in GSIM, the use cases for the different scenarios are explained. These scenarios are:
- Register _as Information Set_ maintained and regularly updated by the statistical organisation.
- Register _as Information Set_ for survey frames/sample frames.
- Register _as Information Set_ for statistical Products.
- Register _as Information Set_ used as direct or auxiliary information for the production of statistics.
- Register _as Information Set_ as a source of administrative information obtained usually from external organisations.
